/*
	Code for generic charge attack:

	A charge attack makes the mob move rapidly towards a target, and then call a proc when the mob either bumps into the target (if dense)
	or enters the same tile as it.

	Generally charging is made for mobs, but it could be used for projectiles too, so i'm leaving it open for all movable atoms


	Charge takes several variables:

		Target: Must be an atom with a non-null location on the same zlevel. Required
		Speed: How fast to move this mob towards the target, in metres (tiles) per second. Required
		Time: Maximum time in deciseconds we will spend attempting to reach the target. If this much time elapses, the charge is aborted
			A time is needed, default is 2 seconds
		Range: Maximum number of tiles we will cross while chasing the target. If we meet this range the charge is aborted
			Optional, the default value of 0 disables range limits
		Homing: If true, we will keep moving towards the target even when they move.
			If false, we will aim at the spot they were standing when we started, and miss them if they aren't in it
			Optional, Default True
		Inertia: CURRENTLY UNIMPLEMENTED
			Only used if homing is false.
			If inertia is true, and we miss the target, we will keep going until we meet maximum range, maximum time, or crash into something dense
			optional, default false
		Power: Used for breaking obstacles mid-charge, this should be a value in the range -3 to 3.
			In most cases, leave it at 0 unless you're doing something special and understand what you're doing
			This will be combined with the size of the charging mob to determine the effect on obstacles in the way
			An ordinary humanoid will have a power of 1
			optional, default 0
