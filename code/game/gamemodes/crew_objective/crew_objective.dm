	Crew objectives are global singletons in a datum ref list

	They mostly consist of a machine or system breaking down, and require a team to be sent to fix it.

	Necromorphs will attempt to ambush people who come to repair it


	To Add a new objective:
		1. Make a new file with a subtype of /datum/crew_objective
		2. Add it to the crew_objectives list in ishimura.dm
