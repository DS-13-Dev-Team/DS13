/*
	A click catcher is an invisible object on the client screen which draws below pretty much everything else, including turfs.
	Because of this, it can only be clicked when the user clicks on blackspace, aka fog of war. Places they can't see.

	In default byond behaviour, clicks on blackspace are largely discarded. For baycode and ss13, this isn't desireable behaviour, so click catchers were
	added to intercept clicks on blackspace. This allows them to be used, for example to fire guns into the darkness
	Consolidating all this in one file

	Click catchers are implemented as single large object covering the screen. They are stored in a global list rather than being recreated


	When and where are click catchers made? :
		1. /mob/Login calls add_click_catcher, in mob/login.dm
		2. /client/set_view_range calls remake_click_catcher, in code/_helpers/client.dm
		3. click_handler.dm, resolve world target

/*
	Task List:
		1. Void is a single click catcher, but the proc creates a bunch of them, WHY. Void should not exist
		2. Is the assumption about number of click catchers correct? Yes but why so many
		3. Is there any possibility of existing click catchers remaining when new ones are added on login?
		4. Find out the ordering of click catcher setting when a mob is logged into and their view range is immediately set
		5. Confirm the draw order of clickcatcher plane
		6. click_handler.dm, resolve world target, calls the resolve proc on a click catcher, maybe replace this with macro
		7. The hand swap code doesn't belong here. Should it go in a click handler?
		8. Bay uses a global list of clickhandler objects, consider doing this too
